                    <p>The San Diego California Temple is the 47th constructed and 45th operating temple of
                         The
                         Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Located near the La Jolla community of San Diego,
                         it
                         was
                         built with two main spires, but unique to this temple are four smaller spires at the base of
                         each
                         main
                         spire. The East spire is topped with the familiar Angel Moroni statue which adorns most LDS
                         temples.
                    </p>
                    <p>The San Diego Temple was announced on April 7, 1984, and dedicated on April 25, 1993
                         by
                         Gordon B. Hinckley. The temple was built on a 7.2-acre (2.9 ha) plot, has 4 ordinance rooms and
                         8
                         sealing
                         rooms, and has a total floor area of 72,000 square feet (6,700 m2).</p>

                    <p>For a faithful Latter-day Saint, there is only one way to be marriedÔªø‚Äîthe Lord‚Äôs way, in one of
                         his
                         holy temples. There,
                         in the terminology of the temple and the Church, the bride and groom are sealed in the temple
                         ordinance. The
                         ramifications and nuances surrounding the word sealing make it of much greater significance
                         than
                         simply being married. </p>
                    <p>

                         One of the most important lessons to learn about a temple sealing or marriage is that you
                         cannot
                         just decide to get
                         married and then run off to the nearest temple.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         There are considerable details that must be attended to before you can be married in the
                         temple.
                         Some have to do with
                         the laws of the Church and some have to do with the laws of the land. And since the Church‚Äôs
                         thirteen operating temples
                         are in thirteen different locationsÔªø‚Äîin five different countriesÔªø‚Äîthere are different legal
                         requirements that must be
                         met.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         A most important point to underline is that if you are considering marriage in a certain
                         temple, you
                         should definitely
                         write or contact in person the president of that temple and request the necessary information.
