          <p class="introInfo">The San Diego California Temple is the 47th constructed and 45th operating temple of The
               Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Located near the La Jolla community of San Diego, it was
               built with two main spires, but unique to this temple are four smaller spires at the base of each main
               spire. The East spire is topped with the familiar Angel Moroni statue which adorns most LDS temples. </p>
          <p class="introInfo">The San Diego Temple was announced on April 7, 1984, and dedicated on April 25, 1993 by
               Gordon B. Hinckley. The temple was built on a 7.2-acre (2.9 ha) plot, has 4 ordinance rooms and 8 sealing
               rooms, and has a total floor area of 72,000 square feet (6,700 m2).</p>
          <p class="introInfo">Although there is no visitors' center, the church maintains the Mormon Battalion Historic
               Site in Old Town, San Diego.</p>
