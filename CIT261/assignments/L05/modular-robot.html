     <p class="question">
          If you were to write that project as a modular program, what modules would you create? Which module would
          depend on
          which other module, and what would their interfaces look like?
     </p>
     <p class="question">
          Which pieces are likely to be available prewritten on NPM? Would you prefer to use an NPM package or write
          them
          yourself?
     </p>
     <p class="answer">
          Hereâ€™s what I would have done (but again, there is no single right way to design a given module): Probably
          written it all myself since I'm still pretty new.
